In 1204 CT images we segmented 104 anatomical structures (27 organs, 59 bones, 10 muscles, 8 vessels) covering a majority of relevant classes for most use cases. The CT images were randomly sampled from clinical routine, thus representing a real world dataset which generalizes to clinical application. The dataset contains a wide range of different pathologies, scanners, sequences and institutions.
